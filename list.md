Context and Problem Statement
Users need a way to navigate through the app to find the products they want/need and get the information they desire and other relevant informattion.

Decision
It was decided to list every meat per store location, divided by meat type and add their details.
It was decided to highlight several products over many of the apps locations to entice the user to buy some meat they/other users enjoy.

Outcome
A list of all supermarkets was made and all the meats available were introduced and sorted.
Each meat got their own details of production and animal life background.
Highlights were made across many parts of the app based on the users' and other users data.

Consequences
Good: Easy to find the meats wanted by the user and provide any information the user might want.
Bad: The search function and display could be simplified and cleaned up.

More Information
Highlights need to be monitored to check if any immediate change is needed to get more interaction if interaction is low.
