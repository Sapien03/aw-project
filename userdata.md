Context and Problem Statement
The application needs an authentication mechanism. Without this mechanism, managing user credentials poses security risks, such as aunothorized access and data breaches. 

Decision
Implement an authentication mechanism that ensures that users don't get their data leaked. This way users can also have their settings stored.

Outcome
It was decided to use a standard login interface and settings menu, with an industry-standard security and authorization protocol.

Consequences
Good: Ensures user security and data storage.
Bad: As an industry-standard it is not the most secure system in the world so it could always need improvements.
